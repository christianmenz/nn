    <h1>Optimization Algo</h1>
    <p>
        The optimization algorithm is a key component to train neural networks. Step by step it tries to find the minima of a function (e.g. a neural net).
        Stochastic gradient descent (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_gradient_descent">SGD</a> is widely used to train neural networks.
