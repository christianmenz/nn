    <h1>Loss function</h1>
    <p>The loss function (also called objective function or cost function) calculates 
        the error between the networks output for a given training sample and the expected result.
        The error is the basis for the backpropagation to work. The training algorithm tries to reduce the cost 
        function step by step.
