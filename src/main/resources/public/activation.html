    <h1>Activation</h1>
    <p>
        The activation of a neuron is like a gate that decides if the signal of the neruon should be trasnmitted or not.
        The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function">sigmoid function</a> is a standard activation function.
        In order to use backpropagation to train a neural net the activation function has to be differentiable.
