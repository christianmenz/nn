    <h1>Batch size</h1>
    <p>
        In machine learning terms the batch size is used to determine how many samples should be trained before updating the weights.
        In this example the batch size controls how many pixels of the image should be trained for each manual step, the application updates
        the weights after each pixel, so technically the batch size is 1.
