    <h1>Batch size</h1>
    <p>
        In machine learning terms the batch size is used to determine how many samples should be trained before updating the weights.
        In this example the batch size controls how many pixels of the image should be trained for each manual step, the application updates
        the weights after each pixel, so technically the batch size is 1.

    <h1>Epoch / iteration</h1>
    
    <p>
        Usually a neural network it trained until the error is getting small enough to fit your needs.
        An epoch is a complete pass through the whole dataset we have. An iteration is basically one batch.
        When we have 100 samples and a batch size of 10 one epoch would have 10 iterations.
