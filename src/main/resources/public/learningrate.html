    <h1>Learning rate</h1>
    <p>Simply put the learning rate controls how quickly the network should change it's weights into the direction it thinks is best. 
        If you choose a small learning rate, the network will take much longer to train, if the learning rate is too high the weights might diverge away.</p>
